## About
These files are configurations for several programs that I use on a (mostly)
daily basis.

The main files of note are:

i3/ -- Dir for configs for the i3 tiling window manager.

zshrc -- My custom zsh runtime configuration.

Xresources -- Contains settings for my terminal theme. I use the urxvt terminal
			for its abundance of features.

urxvt/ -- Contains a font size changing script written in perl.

vim/ -- Dir for my entire vim configuration. At the time of this
		writing I am using vim compiled with the "huge" flag, so that may be
		important to use some features, but most distros compile vim this way
		anyway. I use vim 7.4 currently.

conkyrc  -- Config for conky, a statusline generator.
			I manually make use of the i3ipc protocol here.

fonts/ -- Dir for several of my favorite programming fonts.

vimperatorrc --	Config for my Firefox add-on vimperator that adds vim-like
				keybind support to firefox. Very efficient.
xinitrc -- Script to start X. This might give you an idea as to how my work
			environment works.

xmodmap -- Re-maps a few of my keys to more comfortable positions.

xbindkeysrc -- Contains some custom keyboard shortcut bindings.

mailcap -- Lists the MIME-type info for various user mail agents. I use mutt.

icons/ -- Some of these icons are custom, and some are based on ACYL icons.

themes/ -- A handful of tweaked gtk themes to match my colorscheme.

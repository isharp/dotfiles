## About
These files are configurations for several programs that I use on a (mostly)
daily basis.

The main files of note are:

i3/ -- Dir for configs for the i3 tiling window manager.

zshrc -- My custom zsh runtime configuration.

Xresources -- Contains settings for my terminal theme. I use the urxvt terminal
			for its abundance of features.

urxvt/ -- Contains a font size changing script written in perl.

vim/ -- Dir for my entire vim configuration. At the time of this
		writing I am using vim compiled with the "huge" flag, so that may be
		important to use some features, but most distros compile vim this way
		anyway. I use vim 7.4 currently.

conkyrc  -- Config for conky, a statusline generator.
			I manually make use of the i3ipc protocol here.

fonts/ -- Dir for several of my favorite programming fonts.

vimperatorrc --	Config for my Firefox add-on vimperator that adds vim-like
				keybind support to firefox. Very efficient.
xinitrc -- Script to start X. This might give you an idea as to how my work
			environment works.

xmodmap -- Re-maps a few of my keys to more comfortable positions.

xbindkeysrc -- Contains some custom keyboard shortcut bindings.

mailcap -- Lists the MIME-type info for various user mail agents. I use mutt.

icons/ -- Some of these icons are custom, and some are based on ACYL icons.

themes/ -- A handful of tweaked gtk themes to match my colorscheme.


## License
Feel free to do whatever you want to with them. Just so we're clear on what
that means, read the licenses for these files, if you are so inclined.
Default license if not otherwise specified: Latest WTFPL.

Licence URI: http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/

Caveat(s): the font-size script in the directory 'urxvt' carries its own license
found in the script itself. That license applies to that file. The same goes for
any other files that have their own license notice inside.
